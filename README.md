# CBO Croissanterie

Little fun project, for our agile team, to decide which person needs to prepare the next retrospective or bring delicacies to the office, in a fun way !

Back-end using Node JS with the framework Nest.JS, exposing current list of members & the timing before next elimination.
Front-end using React JS.

Everything wraped up in TypeScript.

- [ ] Back-end : expose API with list of current player & timer till next elemination
- [ ] Front-end : connect to those API

Let's do it !
